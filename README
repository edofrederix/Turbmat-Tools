---- Summary -----------------------------------------------------------------

Turbmat is a Matlab library for the JHU Turbulence Database Cluster. Turbmat
provides a wrapper around Matlab's intrinsic web service functions for calling
the JHU Turbulence Database Cluster.

However, three core SOAP functions have been replaced by lightweight non-DOM
modifications, to enable large requests. For each database function a wrapper
has been created to perform the data translation and retrieval.

This package comes with six ready-to-use example scripts for performing
requests on the JHU Turbulence Database. These scripts do not require any
modification. All input data is required from the user by visual input boxes.

All six scripts make use of the TurbTools class. This class, purposefully
developed for Turbmat, contains a large set of useful functions to request,
parse and visualize data from the database.

To increase the performance of this package, there has been implemented local
caching functionality. This is accomplished by creating an extra layer between
the Matlab code and the database, called TurbCache. The TurbCache class stores
requests in a uniquely named cache file, and tries to retrieve a request
straight from this cache file if possible.


---- Credits -----------------------------------------------------------------

This package is based on the original Turbmat code, written by:

This includes the TurbulenceService class files, as well as the Database
function files, such as getVelocity.m, getVelocityAndPressure.m, etc. These
files still contain the original credentials.

All other code, including all turbm_*.m files, TurbCache.m and TurbTools.m,
but with the exception of turbm_callSoapService.m and
turbm_createSoapMessage.m are written by:

The turbm_callSoapService.m and turbm_createSoapMessage.m files are
modifications of their Matlab originals.

version 3 or any later version. A copy of the GNU GPL v3 resides in this
package. A more formal statement can be found at the bottom of this file.


---- Example scripts ---------------------------------------------------------

As stated, this package contains a few example scripts. These scripts are:

  * PDFs. By fetching a large cube of data, this script calculates the
    probability density functions (PDF) of quantities such as pressure,
    velocity components and velocity gradient components. The velocity
    gradient components are grouped in transverse and longitudinal sets, and
    logarithmically shown.

  * PDF of Velocity Increments.
