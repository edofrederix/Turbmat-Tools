---- Summary -----------------------------------------------------------------

Turbmat is a Matlab library for the JHU Turbulence Database Cluster. Turbmat
provides a wrapper around Matlab's intrinsic web service functions for calling
the JHU Turbulence Database Cluster.

However, three core SOAP functions have been replaced by lightweight non-DOM
modifications, to enable large requests. For each database function a wrapper
has been created to perform the data translation and retrieval.

This package comes with six ready-to-use example scripts for performing
requests on the JHU Turbulence Database. These scripts do not require any
modification. All input data is required from the user by visual input boxes.

All six scripts make use of the TurbTools class. This class, purposefully
developed for Turbmat, contains a large set of useful functions to request,
parse and visualize data from the database.

To increase the performance of this package, there has been implemented local
caching functionality. This is accomplished by creating an extra layer between
the Matlab code and the database, called TurbCache. The TurbCache class stores
requests in a uniquely named cache file, and tries to retrieve a request
straight from this cache file if possible.


---- Credits -----------------------------------------------------------------

This package is based on the original Turbmat code, written by:

This includes the TurbulenceService class files, as well as the Database
function files, such as getVelocity.m, getVelocityAndPressure.m, etc. These
files still contain the original credentials.

All other code, including all turbm_*.m files, TurbCache.m and TurbTools.m,
but with the exception of turbm_callSoapService.m and
turbm_createSoapMessage.m are written by:

The turbm_callSoapService.m and turbm_createSoapMessage.m files are
modifications of their Matlab originals.

---- Example scripts ---------------------------------------------------------

As stated, this package contains a few example scripts. These scripts are:

  * PDFs. By fetching a large cube of data, this script calculates the
    probability density functions (PDF) of quantities such as pressure,
    velocity components and velocity gradient components. The velocity
    gradient components are grouped in transverse and longitudinal sets, and
    logarithmically shown.

  * PDF of Velocity Increments. This scripts fetches a provided number of
    blocks, consisting of 32x128x512 physical grid points, queried by 32x32x32
    points. Within this block, we can calculate velocity increments ranging
    from 1 physical grid point to 256 grid points. This is the equivalent of
    around 2 to 550 Kolmogorov length scales. We can accumulate important
    turbulence statistics from the velocity increments, such as skewness and
    kurtosis. This script presents these statistics in a few graphs.
    
  * 1D Energy Spectrum. This script generates a provided number of randomly
    positioned and oriented lines, crossing the complete simulation domain
    present in the database. For all grid points that are on these lines, the
    inline velocity component is queried. For every single line, we now have a
    signal that can be transformed to the frequency domain, using Matlab's
    standard FFT function. The discrete Fourier transform of the line signals
    can be used to compute the energy spectrum. This energy spectrum is scaled
    and displayed by this script.
    
  * 3D Vorticity.

  * 2D Velocity.

  * 2D Velocity zoom.
