This file contains notes regarding the development of Turbmat. They
are in no order of importance.

Optimizations:

  * turbm_createSoapMessage: generates an XML formatted file directly
    instead of a DOM; originally the MATLAB datatype were converted to
    DOM

  * turbm_callSoapService: removes the need to generate message string
    from DOM by omitting the call to serializeDOM and rather work with
    the message string directly; originally the DOM was converted to
    an XML formatted file which was then sent as the SOAP message to
    the webserver

  * turbm_parseSoapMessage: big optimization; now makes single pass
    through the returned SOAP message and extracts the data (parses
    and stores in MATLAB datatypes); the original converted XML to
    DOM, then the data would be extracted to MATLAB datatypes
